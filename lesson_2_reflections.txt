· What makes a Repository a Repository?
	- For most parts, it just looks like a normal directory on your machine
	※ Git Repository stores a bunch of metadata about the history of the Repository since it was created
		- metadata are in a hidden directory (use ls -a to see)
	- if you see '.git' file, the directory is a Repository

· Initializing a Repository
	- git init
