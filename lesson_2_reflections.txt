· What makes a Repository a Repository?
	- For most parts, it just looks like a normal directory on your machine
	※ Git Repository stores a bunch of metadata about the history of the Repository since it was created
		- metadata are in a hidden directory (use ls -a to see)
	- if you see '.git' file, the directory is a Repository

· Initializing a Repository
	- git init        creates a repository
	- git status      

· Choosing what changes to commit
	- Now you have: working directory with 3 files, repository with 3 same files but untracked
	  Need to put them into a staging area first, and then commit this at once.
	  
	  First: 'git add'    to add files to the staging area
		※ if you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using 'git reset'
	  Then: 'git commit (-m "Commit Message")'   ()里的是optional的，不加的话git会自动弹出editor，叫你写Message
