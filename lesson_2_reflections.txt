· What makes a Repository a Repository?
	- For most parts, it just looks like a normal directory on your machine
	※ Git Repository stores a bunch of metadata about the history of the Repository since it was created
		- metadata are in a hidden directory (use ls -a to see)
	- if you see '.git' file, the directory is a Repository

· Initializing a Repository
	- git init        creates a repository
	- git status      

· Choosing what changes to commit
	- Now you have: working directory with 3 files, repository with 3 same files but untracked
	  Need to put them into a staging area first, and then commit this at once.
	  
	  First: 'git add'    to add files to the staging area
		※ if you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using 'git reset'
	  Then: 'git commit (-m "Commit Message")'   ()里的是optional的，不加的话git会自动弹出editor，叫你写Message
	  		check http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/ for Commit Message Style Guide
	- 所有commit都完成之后，git status的output会是
		On branch master
		nothing to commit, working directory clean
	  注意： 你update了东西的话，git status 就又会出现  modified blah blah blah。要重新add，commit才行
	
	- 如果在status里有modified的文件，但是你想不起来改了什么，可以直接用'git diff' with NO arguments to see
	- 如果要看staging area里的文件，是不是真的是你要update到repository里的，要用'git diff --staged'
	  ※ 如果这个更改不是你想要的，可以用'git reset --hard'来改回到modify之前。但是一定要小心，因为没有commit，所以reset里就回不来了

· Each form of git diff compares
	- git diff: working directory & staging area
	- git diff --staged: staging area & commit1 (most recent commit)
	- git diff commit1 commit2: commit1 & commit2

· Branch
	- Master
		* the name given to the main branch in most of the repositories
		* everytime you create a repository, Git creates a Master Branch for you
	
	- git branch
		* shows your current branches
		* the '*' before a branch means this branch is the one that is currently checked out i.e. the one that will update if you make change
	- git branch xxx  (xxx replaced by new branch name)
		* create a new branch
	- git checkout xxx
		* change checked out branch

	※ 一般如果我们要加feature或改bug，我们会新建一个branch，这样的话，checkout到新的branch上，再修改，master里的file是保持不变的。全部修改完后，再把这些branch merge到一起

	- Viewing the commit history
		* git log --graph --oneline master coins 

	- Combine two branches
		* git merge branch1 branch2 (merge branch2 to branch1)
		  Or EASIER:         git check out branch1
		  					 git merge branch2

		※ which one you should check out depends on which branch LABEL you want to point to the new commit

	※ git merge will also include the currently checked-out branch in the merged version.
		* If you have branch1 CHECKED OUT, and you run 
								'git merge branch2 branch3'
		  the merged version will combine branch1 as well as 2 and 3
		※The key is to remember that 'git merge' will always merges ALL the specified branches into the currently checked out branch, creating a new commmit for that branch※

· Git show
	- git show commit_id    allows you to see the changes introduced by that commit

· Merge Conflicts
	- Eg: Original File: A B D
		  DD's branch: A B' D
		  Ning's branch: A B'' D
	  Q: After merge, what will be in the file?
	  		A,D: Yes   B, B', B'': unknown 因为你不知道最后哪个version会被留下，三种每种都有可能
	- Conflict Detection
		* Git just assumes if you are merging two commits that have changes in the same general area, the author may wanna know it and decide which version to leave.
	- merge时有conflict的话，要打开file看，是哪里有conflict，然后决定留哪个version，把不用的都去掉，包括git的special 
	  comment也去掉，然后存起来。 再用 git add, git commit

· git log -n 1
	- '-n' means that git log will only show that number of commands, here number is 1
